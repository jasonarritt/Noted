## Installation

There is no installation required. The user just needs to visit the link at which Noted is hosted: <https://noted-again.herokuapp.com/>

## Usage

Upon navigating their browser to the Noted application link, the user will be greeted with the “Note Taker” title page. Click the “Get Started” button to be taken to the notes page. On the notes page the user can review their existing notes as well as add new notes. To add a new note, click the + (plus) icon at the top right corner. Once the “Note Title” and “Note Text” fields have been populated a save icon (floppy disk) will appear next to the + sign. Click on the save icon to store the note for the future and the new note will be added to the list of notes on the left.
